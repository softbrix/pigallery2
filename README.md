This is a directory-first photo gallery website, optimised for running on low resource servers (especially on raspberry pi)

## Live Demo
Live Demo @ heroku: https://pigallery2.herokuapp.com/ 
 - the demo page **first load** might take up **30s**: the time while the free webservice boots up

## 1. Getting started (on Raspberry Pi)
### 1.1 Direct Install
### 1.1.0 [Install NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
Download and extract
```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Full node install on raspberry pi description: https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_raspberrypi.asp
 
### 1.1.1 Install PiGallery2
#### 1.1.1-a Install from release

```bash
cd ~
wget https://github.com/bpatrik/pigallery2/releases/download/1.5.6/pigallery2.zip
unzip pigallery2.zip -d pigallery2
cd pigallery2
npm install
```
#### 1.1.1-b Install from source
```bash
cd ~
wget https://github.com/bpatrik/pigallery2/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd pigallery2-master # enter the unzipped directory
npm install
```
**Note**: if you run `npm run build-release`, it creates a clean, minified, production ready version from the app in the `release` folder, that is ready to deploy.

#### 1.1.2 Run PiGallery2
```bash
npm start
```
To configure it, run `PiGallery2` first to create `config.json` file, then edit it and restart.
The app has a nice UI for settings, you may use that too. 
Default user: `admin` pass: `admin`

### 1.2 Run with Docker 
If you have `docker` and don't want to install all the dependencies, use this:
```bash
docker run \
   -p 80:80 \
   -e NODE_ENV=production \
   -v <path to your config file folder>/config.json:/pigallery2-release/config.json \
   -v <path to your db file folder>/sqlite.db:/pigallery2-release/sqlite.db \
   -v <path to your images folder>:/pigallery2-release/demo/images \
   -v <path to your temp folder>:/pigallery2-release/demo/TEMP \
   bpatrik/pigallery2:1.5.6-stretch
```
Make sure that a file at `<path to your config file folder>/config.json` and `sqlite.db` files exists before running it. 

You do not need the `<path to your db file folder>/sqlite.db` line if you don't use the sqlite database.

After the container is up and running, you go to `http://localhost` and log in with user: `admin` pass: `admin` and set up the page in the settings. 

**All docker builds**: https://hub.docker.com/r/bpatrik/pigallery2/tags/

**Note**: You dont need to do the installation steps if you are using docker. 


### 1.3 Advanced configuration
You can set up the app the following ways:
 * Using the UI
 * Manually editing the `config.json`
 * Through switches
   * Like: `node backend/index.js --Server-port=3000 --Client-authenticationRequired=false`
   * You can check the generated `config.json` for the config hierarchy
 * Through environmental variable
   * like set env. variable `Server-port` to `3000`   

### 1.4 Useful links/tips:

#### using nginx
It is recommended to use a reverse proxy like nginx before node
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5009324/node-js-nginx-what-now

#### making https
With cerbot & nginx it is simple to set up secure connection. You have no excuse not doing so.
https://certbot.eff.org/

#### node install error:
If you get error during module installation, make sure you have everything to build node modules from source
```bash
apt-get install build-essential  libkrb5-dev gcc g++
```


## 2. Translate the page to your own language
1. [Install Pigallery2](#111-b-install-from-source) from source (with the release it won't work) 
2. add your language e.g: fr
   ```bash
   npm run add-translation -- --fr
   ```
   it creates a new `messages.fr.xls` file at `frontend/translate` folder, 
   it will already contain dummy translation with google translate.
3. 'fix' the dummy translation
4. test if it works:
   build and start the app
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
5. (optional) create a pull request at github to add your translation to the project.

**Note**: you can also build your own release with as described in [1.1.1-b Install from source](#111-b-install-from-source);

## 4. Known errors
* EXIF orientation tag:
  *  There is no nice way to handle EXIF orientation tag properly.
The page handles these photos, but might cause same error in the user experience (e.g.: the pages loads those photos slower. See issue [#11](https://github.com/bpatrik/pigallery2/issues/11))
* Video support on weak servers (like raspberry pi) with low upload rate
  * video playback may use up too much resources and the server might not response for a while. A solution might be to down scale / convert the video files to lower bitrate.
